### Backlog

### Submission

Feedback: Pass, There is only one file uploaded on gitlab and it's a PDF file.

### Backlog Structure

Feedback: Pass, All the main elements are present and have been covered thoroughly. It even includes mockups. Make sure to read through your document there are a couple of spelling/grammar mistakes.

### Epics

Feedback: Insufficient, the epics are missing right now. Make sure the epics are complete, prioritized from top to bottom and that they are consistent with the lecture. Each of the epic need to have their feature described and you can use your mockups to complement the description. Overal just make sure to read the assignment for this carefully.

### User Stories

Feedback: sufficient, The requirements are there but they are still lacking in a couple of areas. First of all make sure to follow the format (as *role*, want to *requirement* so I can *reason*). This will create some extra clarity. Make sure that the user stories only have one particular interaction. For example create and remove are two different interactions I suggest you to split them up making them also more measurable. On the positive side the requirements don't overlap or contradict each other which is great and they have a clear focus on the user perspective. One last note when adding epics make sure that the user stories cover the description and that the user stories are grouped by epic! 

### Acceptance Criteria

Feedback: sufficient, Most user stories are small and their effect is clear, so their acceptance criteria are implicit. causing them to also be measurable/observable. But a couple of user stories could be made smaller especially the one about recovery key. Rewrite these requirements or split them up but make sure it's clear. For this example you could just say something along the lines of that you want to receive a recovery key upon creation of a password for a board, so I can *reason*. But if there are still overloaded user stories make sure to disambiguated them by defining concrete acceptance criteria.
