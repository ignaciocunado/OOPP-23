#### Meeting Organization

pass, There was a chairman and minute taker.

#### Agenda

Feedback: Good, The agenda was not delivered before the meeting. Might have been because I couldn't find anybody on mattermost, so there was no easy way to communicate. Overal the agenda looks good. keep the time stamps. For next time do put in the agenda if the agenda-item is to Inform/brainstorm/ decision making/ discuss and try to give the agende 1-2 days before the meeting

#### Chair performance

Feedback: sufficient, all topics in the agenda were covered. Although there seemed to be a slight misunderstanding who has to ensure the topics are covered. So next time the chairman needs to make sure when they move on if they for example don't have enough time.

#### Time management

Feedback: Suffiecient, There was enough time to cover the topics but a couple had be cut short to move on to the next one. Make sure to have topics that fit in the time frame and let the chairman take care of the time management.

#### Minute taker performance

Feedback: Excelent, The Minute taker was actively taking notes during the meeting and the main points seem to be in there with a short explanation. well done.

#### Relation

Feedback: Excelent, For all the topics there were healthy discussions. It wasn't the case that the chairman was the only one speaking up. Keep this up!
